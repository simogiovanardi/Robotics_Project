This project is related to the "Industrial and Collaborative Robotics" University course, done in Matlab.
There are 3 exercises, where:
- 1_1 and 1_2 are intended to create the trajectory to be followed by the "Universal UR5" kinematic manipulator;
- exercise 2_1 is related to the control of a mobile robot using the IO-SFL (pure pursuit) algorithm.
